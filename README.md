# Venue

## Description

Venue is a full-stack platform where concert goers can extensively search through all the concerts occuring in Nashville on a given night. The application prevents Nashvillians from missing shows from their favorite artists, allows users to discover new favorites, and supports local, independently owned venues by providing a larger market presence. Concert goers can filter shows by date and venue, and add new venues or shows when announced. Venue's server-side is built with Django Rest Framework/Python and React and Tailwind CSS on client-side to provide full CRUD functionality, secure user authentication, and a smooth and efficient user experience.
